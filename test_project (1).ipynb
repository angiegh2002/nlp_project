colleague who risked imprisonment to smuggle them out and show the world the full horror of what happened john elder and armin t wegner both documented the unimaginable suffering they witnessed in images which helped build a case against a turkish government which still denies the slaughter of up to 15million armenians constituted genocide as armenians mark 100 years since the atrocities many western countries still do not use that word and us president barack obama is once again unlikely to do so in his upcoming statement marking the anniversary despite pledging he would during his election campaign scroll down for video an image of a starving armenian orphan taken by john elder more than 150000 armenian children were left parentless by the end of 1918 armenian deportees travel on foot in 1915 as taken by armin wegner including women and children on an unpaved road in the desert sun a crowd looks on as armenians are hanged in the street in constantinople before their forced removal to the desert had begun after april 1915 this image was titled abandoned and murdered small children of the armenian deportees by wegner and was taken in 19151916 wegner a volunteer military nurse set up clandestine mail routes with foreign consulates and embassies to get many hundreds of notes annotations documents letters and photographs of the armenian deportation camps to germany and the united states he did so in defiance of strict orders from the turkish and german authorities aimed at preventing any evidence of the horrors of the genocide reaching the outside world but his ruse was discovered and he was arrested by the german authorities and put to serve in cholera wards in baghdad at the request of the turkish command there he fell seriously ill and germanborn wegner left for constantinople modernday istanbul in november 1916 hidden in his belt were his photographic plates and those of other german officers with images of the armenian massacre to which he had been a witness his images which along with elders were provided to mailonline by the washington dcbased armenian national institute still retain the power to shock as the world marks the 100th anniversary of the genocide today in one two armenians are pictured hanging in the street in broad daylight in the capital constantinople while a crowd including women and children looks on the image was taken in

graveyard while a black clad figure walks away from the camera in igdir now in eastern anatolia in turkey armenian deportees sleeping in the street in 1915 in the syrian region of the ottoman empire they are mostly women without families orphans of the massacre take a rest hundreds of thousands of armenians were forced from their homes in anatolia and herded towards syria three generations of the same family of refugees take shelter from the son in a makeshift tent many of those targeted for expulsion starved to death were shot or bayoneted by ottoman turkish soldiers genocide is defined as the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national racial political or cultural group it was apparently coined by polishborn us jurist raphael lemkin in his work axis rule in occupied europe in reference to the nazi extermination of the jews the word literally means killing a tribe from the greek genos meaning race or kind lemkin wrote that it is intended to signify a coordinated plan of different actions aimed at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national groups with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves thanks to lemkins campaigning work the un general assembly adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide on december 9 1948 the then two million strong armenian minority were persecuted by a government suspicious that as christians they were more loyal to christian governments like that of russia than they were to the ottoman caliphate though they had thrived under ottoman rule despite being regarded as infidels by their muslim rulers the armenians were resented for their relative prosperity and success compared to many ottoman turks the ottoman government began their campaign in earnest after armenians organized volunteer battalions to help the russian army fight against the turks in the caucasus region the ottoman government used this as a justification to begin their forced removal of armenians the war zones along the eastern front in a bid to turkify what remained of a ailing empire the deportation began following the rounding up of 235 armenian leaders and intellectuals in the capital on april 24 1915 the anniversary of which is marked today many of those then targeted for expulsion starved to death were shot or bayoneted by ottoman turkish soldiers another photograph shows

than a targeted programme of extermination by the ottoman government recep tayyip erdogan the turkish president said at a press conference on wednesday he would not want obama to use the word genocide and would not expect such a thing the countrys prime minister ahmet davutoglu accused the european parliament of enmity against turkey over its vote to use the term to describe the killings in his

particularly vocal about making his mark on history when india successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around mars last year modi reveled in the moment history has been created today he said we have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible the success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation soon after the galactic feat he took to the stage at new yorks famous madison square garden and received a welcome so rapturous that jon stewart called him americas first modi and all along modi has issued his call to make in india encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in india where there is a vast talent pool and lowcost production while modis india is out to put its economy on the fast track chinas economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth president xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending while cracking down hard on corruption and its been predicted that india could outpace china as the worlds fastest growing economy as soon as this year so is the worlds largest democracy primed to overtake the worlds biggest single party state as the next economic miracle opinion what india can learn from china not so fast says china watcher and india today correspondent ananth krishnan china is still pulling away from india the beijingbased reporter said if india grows 75 this year and china grows 74 i think it makes a good headline but i think people shouldnt get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between china and india chinas economy may be slowing down but india faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure in terms of education having access to different resources and job creation china has done well it has progressed far better compared to india said infosys china ceo rangarajan r vellamore even though there is free movement across the country in india the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education in a recent budget the modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth but despite modis big probusiness push india simply cant size up against chinas raw economic might after 30 years of dedicated efforts in building china into a manufacturing powerhouse it would take a long time for india to build that kind of manufacturing capability said haiyan wang managing partner of the china india institute its not just about lower labor costs you have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains you have to have the knowledge you have to have the skills you have to be connected to the international market she said so when you ask if india could compete with china i dont think that is going to be happening not in the next 20 years the indian elephant may be charging ahead but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead china has the capacity the connectivity and the capital to throw its weight around and being a single party state with no free elections xi can march toward a longterm goal without fretting about the next election but thats not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region even if china is putting money into the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and the silk road fund it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the south china sea said krishnan there no question that indias rise is far less threatening than chinas rise with the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in india the impression of china as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries if you look at indias seven northeastern states which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure its inconceivable for any of those states to allow a chinese company to come and build roads said krishnan so when modi touches down in beijing next month for his second meeting with xi can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business as pragmatic as president xi is as pragmatic as prime minister modi is economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100 trust or not said haiyan wang eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance if these two countries come together 40 of the worlds people are going to be prosperous said vellamore if they are able to come together there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of asia its a

minutes after that he completed his hattrick from bales pass the welsmans ball found him in space down the left rodriguez made a run on the outside and as the defenders were dragged one way ronaldo

            "Original: cnnthe reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect according to a tulsa oklahoma investigator tulsa police sgt jim clark who has been brought in to review the case said tulsa county reserve deputy robert bates 73 inadvertently shot eric courtney harris after harris a possibly pcpaddled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting as deputies tried to handcuff harris bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand he warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a taser on the suspect but instead he fired a single gunshot and immediately apologized clark said citing a recently released video clark attributed bates actions to a phenomenon known as slip and capture an example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission the driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly even though theres no clutch pedal he said quoting bill lewinski executive director of the force science institute clark further explained these are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended in effect your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction bates announced that he was going to deploy his taser and he pulled the trigger only once as he was trained to do clark said police are trained to doubletap when firing their handguns he said the gun jumped out of bates hand because he wasnt expecting recoil clark said and bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot harris quoting lewinski again clark said this is the slip and capture under time pressure to address a perceived threat his intention to draw his taser slipped off his agenda so to speak when it was captured and completed by a more wellrehearsed motor program he was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired in his urgency his concentration was focused exclusively on harris back where he intended to place the taser darts because of whats called inattentional blindness meaning that he wasnt consciously paying attention to and registering it he wouldnt have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the taser and in this case the weight of the gun and taser are nearly identical clark was emphatic that bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim reserve deputy bates did not commit a crime reserve deputy bates was a victim a true victim of slip and capture he said theres no other determination i could come to when they set up the undercover sting police wanted evidence on camera but when they recorded the operation targeting harris earlier this month cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran and as he was fatally shot the tulsa county sheriffs office released the video on friday the shooting was an apparent accident it has said in the last minutes of the video harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him an officer calls for a taser but in place of an electric clicking sound a gunshot rings out a voice can be heard saying oh i shot him im sorry another officer screams out he shot him he shot him harris who is bleeding calls out too hes losing his breath he says an officer yells back at him you fking ran shut the fk up he yells fk your breath he said clark defended the officers language saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running the language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified clark said one deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site its very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someones life and this deputy one of the involved deputies was upset he said secondly this is total stress they are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed clark added they did not know that he was shot at this time they had audio exclusion they was at a point where they couldnt hear they didnt even hear the gunshot go off the officers did not know that mr harris had been shot an officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from harris shortly after the suspect is shot the officers begin tugging harris hands behind his back as the video ends harris later died at a local hospital police said at the time of the shooting that harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine a street drug commonly known as pcp the video is edited to block out the officers faces harris is clearly visible minutes earlier harris had climbed into a truck cab where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect whats up they greet each other cordially without missing a beat harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol every few seconds he looks around outside nervously sweet thats a nice gun man the undercover officer says off camera its a german luger harris tells him he cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck officers in uniform jump out and harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off hes running hes running hes running the officer in the truck says as harris fled police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun clark said adding that no gun was found when harris was searched after the chase another video from an officers body camera picks up the chase the officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues harris on foot catching up to him easily he tackles the fleeing suspect the officer commands him i need you to roll on your stomach now other officers appear someone calls taser taser the gun discharges much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck two men are conversing he thought it was his taser one of them says as the other curses in frustration in the background a woman is crying no no no harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion police have said that harris had reached for his waistband and officers feared he might endanger them when harris was on the ground he refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband they said after the shooting the officers body camera video did not reveal that area of harris body bates a former tulsa police officer was placed on administrative leave after the shooting the sheriffs office has said asked whether bates age may have been a factor in the shooting clark said its happened to 21yearold law enforcement officers its happened to 30yearold law enforcement officers age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events despite the details released over the weekend harris brother says he still want answers i want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose these are all the things that not only i want but the public wants andre harris told cnn affiliate ktul bates attorney scott wood told cnn on friday he would contact the network later he had not issued a statement or called

to ships and taken to other european countries and to africa and asia and i reflected on one of the most stunning turnaround stories in the economic history of this country scroll down for video britain last year produced more than 15 million cars the most since 2007 and we are poised to overtake france and become the second biggest car manufacturing power in europe across the west midlands and indeed across the country there are now literally thousands of businesses large and small that are engaged in automotive innovation and supply and there was a time when no one would have believed that was possible i remember the 1970s you too may remember that mullet haired decade the music was superb the food was mediocre and british industry was on its knees i remember when our motor manufacturing industry was in the hands of conveners and shop stewards and when the man who ran british leyland then our biggest car company appeared to be an avowedly communist trade union official called red robbo when i was a child i am afraid to say that british cars were the butt of international derision they leaked oil and they were generally assembled with such slovenly imprecision they gained a reputation for unreliability that it has taken decades to shake off lemon after lemon rolled off our production lines culminating in the ludicrous rustbucket called the austin allegro and there was a reason for the disaster boris johnson the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s we had atrocious relations between management and unions and a legal framework that gave all the power to the unions we had a labour government that believed companies existed not to serve the needs of the market or the desires of their customers but to satisfy the rights of their workers we had an era of tea breaks and demarcation disputes and closed shops and oneoutallout strikes with the labour government trying to impose such insane solutions as tony benns communiststyle motorbike collective at meriden it did not work then and it seems to me to be deranged that we could be even contemplating going back to such arrangements now i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the labour party manifesto is my former adversary ken livingstone who has long been on the bennite wing by ed milibands own admission livingstone has been a big influence in his thinking and in their return to the bennlivingstone approach labours plans are truly nightmarish for business and enterprise miliband is turning the labour party sharply back to the left and actively repudiating the chief insight of tony blair that the party can only be successful if it makes a sensible accommodation with capitalism and the market economy that is why british business people are so unanimous in their horror including many former labour supporters and donors they are not wrong labour wants to hit small and medium sized businesses with more corporation tax and higher national insurance but it is worse than that i am not surprised to discover that one of the key authors of the labour party manifesto is my former adversary ken livingstone they want to recreate the stifling environment of the 1970s in which management was deprived of the ability to manage they want to make it easier for employees to take firms to employment tribunals when you might think the system was already out of control with people endlessly and automatically and indeed very often vexatiously claiming racial or sexual or age or disability discrimination they want all companies with more than 50 employees to have a system of profitsharing a return to bennery and they want the workers to be able to block takeovers that is before you have even begun to calculate the impact of their attacks on the city higher income tax and the higher interest rates that small firms would have to cope with the result of labours failure to tackle the deficit what makes this anticapitalist agenda so dangerous is that the british motor manufacturing industry is not in the hands of a few giant firms we are talking about huge numbers of often tiny companies firms that pride themselves on making a more efficient windscreenwiper or a quieter airconditioning unit or a more easily wipeable dashboard fascia it is incredible but true that britain now has more specialised motor manufacturing marques than any country on earth lotus mclaren bristol morgan caterham tvr the list goes on think of londons new hopon hopoff routemaster bus a glorious piece of lowcarbon technology and one of the greenest new buses on the market made in northern ireland by wrightbus the west midlands is once again the epicentre of one of the worlds densest ecosystems of motor manufacturing and development british brands have shed their 1970s reputations they are taking on the world and winning how mad how tragic that this extraordinary british triumph should be faced with a labour government that regards capitalism as predatory the problem with ed miliband is not his method of consuming a bacon sarnie in fact i totally sympathise on that one the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s writes boris johnson the problem is not even that he crashed the economy last time though he did he and balls were at the controls in downing street when this country experienced the worst economic catastrophe in living memory a catastrophe that was gravely exacerbated by their irresponsible fiscal policies the problem with ed miliband is that he wants to take the country back to the 1970s he genuinely thinks france is the model we should emulate when the french whatever the splendours of their civilisation have 12 per cent unemployment and when huge numbers of the most talented french people have decided that they wish france was more like britain how many brits work in paris 16000 how many french men and women live and work in london about 400000 mais oui that should tell miliband all he needs to know about the relative dynamism and competitiveness of the two economies labour wants to go back to the 1970s ukip to some nonexistent version of a monochrome 1950s the greens would like to go back to the middle of the stone age and the lib dems would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls there is only one party presenting itself for election on may 7 that seems to believe in the genius of this country and that has a plan to take it forward the lib dems under nick clegg would probably settle for any epoch in which they were above five per cent in the polls it is only the conservatives that understand the real economic and social significance of all those british cars lined up at bristol they arent the results of an evil and predatory system by which workers are exploited and the boss class luxuriate in ever greater privilege they are the fruits of a long and painful postwar period in which britain has learned that in order to survive we must innovate and compete and that we cannot hope to compete if we overtax and overregulate in the way that ed miliband is proposing those britishmade vehicles are the sign of an economy that is back on its feet after the labourmade disaster of 20089 in which motor manufacturing fell by half a million cars an economy that has seen the creation since 2010 of about two million jobs and those glistening british cars at the bristol docks therefore embody the great moral purpose of wealth creation because it is only if you have a strong and vibrant economy that you can hope to raise the tax to pay for roads and schools and hospitals and pensions and welfare not to speak of strong defences and all the other civilised objectives that we want to meet i really dont think miliband gets that he is one of those theoretical socialists who thinks the problem with socialism is it has never been properly tried and i am horrified at the idea he should be given another go there is only one party presenting itself for election on may 7 that believes that on the whole today is better than yesterday and tomorrow is going to be better than today that is david cameron and the conservatives we need five more years to entrench this economic recovery five years to take this country forwards and not backwards that is the battle for britain next month and one this country cant afford to lose\n",

from the official search led by australian authorities locals from the island of kudahuvadhoo located in the southern area of the dhaalu atoll in the maldives reported witnessing a lowflying jumbo jet on the morning of march 8 last year when the flight disappeared while travelling from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board the reports come as acoustic scientists from curtin university refuse to rule out the possibility that distinctive data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the indian ocean locals from the island of kudahuvadhoo in the maldives reported witnessing a lowflying jumbo jet on the morning of march 8 last year when mh370 disappeared kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the dhaalu atoll in the maldives in the indian ocean despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of perth locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings similar to those of the missing plane on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the mh370s disappearance reported the weekend australian villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed im very sure of what i saw on a very clear and bright day and what i saw was not normal the plane was very big and low i did not know until later that other people saw it too i dont know if its the malaysia plane said ahmed shiyaam 34 an it manager abdu rasheed ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water and did not know at the time that it could be the missing malaysian airlines flight i didnt know that a plane was missing i went straight home and told my wife about it i told my family i saw this strange plane this is the biggest plane i have ever seen from this islandi have seen pictures of the missing plane i believe i saw the planei strongly felt those people who were searching should come here mr ibrahim said the maldvies national defence force released a statement in march last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities a local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast and that the plane was travelling so low its doors could be seen ive never seen a jet flying so low over our island before weve seen seaplanes but im sure that this was not one of those i could even make out the doors on the plane clearly an eyewitness told the website malaysian airlines flight mh370 disappeared while travelling from kuala lumpur to beijing with 239 people on board the search for the missing plane has been headed up by the joint agency coordination centre the search has focused on 60000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of western australia its not just me either several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too the plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from kuala lumpur it was then tracked by malaysias military radar heading towards the indian ocean over the past year the search for the missing plane by the joint agency coordination centre headed by australia has focused on 60000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of western australia the location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded pings or electronic handshakes sent between mh370 and a satellite for the final hours of its journey the flight made a number of unexplained deviations and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with air traffic control while flying between malaysia and vietnam as of early march 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far based on all available data as well as circumstances survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely it is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare malaysia airlines flight mh370 an accident said malaysias civil aviation chief azharuddin abdul rahman malaysias civil aviation chief azharuddin abdul rahman declared the crash an accident dr alec duncan left from curtin universitys centre for marine science and technology began investigating a lowfrequency underwater sound signal the signal was recorded west of rottnest island using acoustic recorders above at 130 am on march 8 the reports from kudahuvadhoo follow information released from curtin university that a clear acoustic signal was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the planes disappearance dr alec duncan and his associates from the universitys centre for marine science and technology began investigating a lowfrequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of rottnest island just after 130 am utc on march 8 the centre along with united nations comprehensive nucleartestban treaty organisation ctbto and geoscience australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search and originally determined that the noises source was close to the maldives and kudahuvadhoo data from one of the imos integrated marine observing system recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of mh370 dr duncan said in a statement released by curtin university an indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight relatives of the missing passengers of flight mh370 visit a temple in china to pray for their family members relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that mh370 plunged into the sea on march 24 2014 the crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds dr duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event including a small earth tremor but the timing piqued the interest of his research team it would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of mh370 he told the weekend australian in early march malaysias transport minister liow tiong lai said that data will be reexamined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of may it is one year since malaysia airlines flight mh370 went missing here is a

eight years and was commended for bravery said some workers would even stay and watch the battle unfold while others turned a blind eye to it he also said gangs controlled entire wings at the jail in hounslow south west london leaving staff afraid to visit some areas of the prison for fear of being attacked scroll down for video peter hiett a decorated former prison guard at feltham young offenders institution in hounslow pictured claims staff regularly arrange brutal fights between rival criminals behind bars at britains toughest jail the claims echo scenes from 1999 film fight club starring brad pitt in which gangsters organise mass brawls in underground fight clubs mr hiett told the sunday people it was like a sport for them if two inmates had a grudge theyd put them together in a room to sort it out they only stopped when one was knocked out or couldnt defend themselves any more his revelations come after he left the prison in january last year amid claims he was forced out for trying to lift the lid on the goingson he claims the infighting was often kept hidden from the overriding authorities with the prisons management setting up a behaviour management group to fiddle the assault figures he said common tactics were to treat group attacks as just one assault and to encourage inmates to admit to the lesser charge of health and safety over assault the former officer said there would be 15 or 20 lads from the same gang on the same wing they would protect each other deal drugs and if they saw another gang member all hell broke loose their wars dont stop when theyre behind bars but if an inmate assaulted someone the governor didnt want it written down like that staff would advise prisoners to admit a lesser charge there were high levels of

staff in a very determined way feltham is divided into two sites with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site a and 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site b mr hiett said he tried to raise his concerns several times internally before he eventually approached jeremy wright who was the minister for prisons at the time mr wright ordered an inspection of the prison in march 2013 and called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted despite calls for an overhaul feltham was named last year as the most violent prison in england and wales by the howard league for penal reform but the authorities believe improvements are underway and it is simply taking time to see the changes because of the multiple challenges that

improvements to feltham a have been made and we are grateful to the inspection team for recognising the dedication of the staff who work there however and as the report also acknowledges the young people placed in feltham are some of the most challenging of the cohort we have across the youth secure estate improving feltham a is very much a work in progress and will take time because of the multiple challenges that need to be addressed in response to mr hietts claims a spokesman for hm prison service told mailonline these inflammatory and damaging allegations are completely untrue and do a huge disservice to the hard working staff at yoi feltham it is totally untrue to claim that staff have been complicit in any acts of violence or that there are nogo areas within the establishment it

how we ended up with the tired failed politics that we have now natalie bennett it was not polish care workers or estonian bar workers who caused this economic crisis it was bankers leanne wood you can come into britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with hiv and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to 25000 a year per patient i know there are some horrible things happening in many part of the world but what we need to do is put the national health service there for british people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades at the end of the historic contest mr miliband said youve heard from seven leaders tonight but theres one fundamental choice if im prime minister i will make sure everyone will play by the same rules if im prime minister we will cut the deficit every year i believe that when working people succeed britain succeeds if you believe in that too then i ask for your vote mr cameron had the last word after drawing the final slot telling viewers ive been your prime minister for the last five years and all that time ive tried to have one task in mind above all others and that has been turning our economy around

dwarf planet and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission however the images have not yet revealed what the mystery bright spots on the surface of the world are which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike nasa scientists in california have released new images of ceres shown they were taken by the dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21000 miles 33000km the spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to ceres and it will soon study the whole planet including its mystery bright spots the latest images were taken on 10 april from a distance of 21000 miles 33000km and are the highestresolution views of ceres so far the spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light and it will also see ceres in better and a higher resolution ceres is 590 miles 950 km across and was discovered in 1801 it is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a dwarf planet it lies less than three times as far as earth from the sun close enough to feel the warmth of the star allowing ice to melt and reform nasas dawn spacecraft has been making its way to ceres from the asteroid vesta since september 2012 there is high interest in the mission because ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system and may also have shifting ice on its surface ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter with an average diameter of 590 miles 950km dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid vesta in 2012 its first science orbit will begin on 23 april with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8400 miles 13500km away until 9 may after this it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface the mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between earth and jupiter that has yet to be explored the mission is so exciting because were exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system dr marc rayman dawn chief engineer and mission director at jpl told mailonline for me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries a mysterious world of rock and ice perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds lakes or oceans is very exciting shown above is an animation of ceres rotating as dawn observed its north pole ceres is about 28 times further from the sun than earth and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine earth hours credit nasa dawn artists illustration shown has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid vesta in 2012 its first science orbit will begin on 23 april with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8400 miles 13500km away until 9 may in the next few weeks and months the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail but the most impressive images will be returned in december when dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits it will be at an altitude of just 225 miles 360km above the surface below the orbital height of the international space station around earth allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface the primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until june 2016 by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date as it will probably start running out of fuel by then this mapprojected view of ceres was created from images taken by nasas dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet prior to being captured into orbit in march 2015 differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest ceres was once an active body perhaps of most interest though are the mystery bright spots on the surface these are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on ceres based on new infrared images released by nasa the other day it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties suggesting they have different origins they could also be towering water volcanoes but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this the bright spots continue to fascinate the science team but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source said chris russell from the university of california los angeles these images from dawns visible and infrared mapping spectrometer vir highlight two regions on ceres containing bright spots the images suggest they coudl be towering water volcanoes but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this the bright spots seen in this previous nasa image continue to fascinate the science team but we will have to wait

            "Original: cnnrelations between iran and saudi arabia have always been thorny but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today tehran and riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the middle east in its most recent incarnation the iraniansaudi conflict by proxy has reached yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic for riyadh and its regional allies the saudi military intervention in yemen operation decisive storm is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shiairanian influence for tehran and its regional allies including the houthi movement in yemen saudi arabias actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war when iranian president hassan rouhani was elected in june 2013 he pledged to reach out to riyadh he was up front and called tehrans steep deterioration of relations with the saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on iranian foreign policy from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistan and the gaza strip the iraniansaudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly and yet despite rouhanis open pledge profound differences over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels unlike in syria and in iraq the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranianbacked rebels in yemen while riyadh no doubt exaggerates tehrans role in the yemen crisis its fingerprints are nonetheless evident iran provides financial support weapons training and intelligence to houthis gerald feierstein a us state department official and former yemen ambassador told a congressional hearing last week we believe that iran sees opportunities with the houthis to expand its influence in yemen and threaten saudi and gulf arab interests the iranians find the charges biased and point to the saudi airstrikes in yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbors affairs in iran the cue came from the countrys top authority supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who has been unusually blunt he tweeted despite disputes the saudis used to display composure with us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power replaced composure with barbarism three days after khameneis speech iran suspended religious pilgrimages to mecca this came as news broke about two iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudi arabia meanwhile antisaudi protests have been staged in a number of iranian cities khameneis speech opened the floodgate of antisaudi statements the voices of hardline figures in tehran have been the most agitated general ahmad purdastan the commander of the iranian ground forces taunted the saudis beware of the day when firecrackers explode in riyadh purdastan said in a notsosubtle warning but it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the saudis ayatollah aliakbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president and arguably irans most vocal advocate of better iraniansaudi relations called riyadhs military intervention a strategic mistake and urged for a political solution seeking a political solution is irans stated aim for the yemeni crisis but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim iranian foreign minister javad zarif has provided a fourpoint plan to get a ceasefire to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid to promote political dialogue among warring yemeni parties and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government but the iranian proposal also asks for an end to saudi airstrikes as zarif put it iran and saudi arabia need to talk but we cannot talk to determine the future of yemen the saudis have thus far ignored the iranian proposal meanwhile the houthi leadership has welcomed the plan as one of its leaders said in irans plan unacceptable solutions do not exist not only do the saudis not have any faith in any iraniandrafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis but riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it saudi arabia was elated by the un security council vote on 14 april that condemned the houthi movement only russia abstained but a solution to the yemeni crisis will not come from the un the un can provide a cover for riyadhs military intervention but it cannot secure it a military win this leaves riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in yemen saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the houthi movement and it allies in the yemeni armed forces it requires ground troops on a huge scale riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco the pakistanis most famously turned down the saudi request and let it be known that yemen is a quagmire they can do without instead islamabad has asked iran to push the houthis for a political compromise that riyadh can live with the turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis but in his visit to tehran last week turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized iranianturkish trade relations over rivalry in yemen and emphasized a political solution for the yemeni conflict the egyptians and the jordanians are still supportive of saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist riyadh in yemen but whether they will go through with it is another matter egypt has a long list of problems of its own including a bloody counterterrorism campaign in sinai that it cannot afford to lose but also an eastern border with lawless libya that is increasingly a new front in cairos fight against jihadists it is hard to see how egyptian general abdel fattah elsisi can commit troops to a yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to egypts security the same kind of domestic realities including the threat from isis will also prevent jordan from any significant contribution to saudi military efforts in yemen these hard realities leave riyadh with two options it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same houthis that riyadh is attacking today alternatively given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops riyadh will have to contemplate a fullscale invasion of yemen that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate the iranians too are faced with stark choices it is beyond tehrans ability to tame the yemeni crisis as tempting as it might be for tehran to see the saudis bleed in yemen the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the middle east will undermine broader regional iranian interests a political compromise that both riyadh and tehran and their respective yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic\n",

turn was fined by the browns manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior saying its about being accountable instead of looking like a jackass and while his season may have been over at that time many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano at this point some in the sports world chief among them columnist skip bayless began to suggest that the heisman trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking the aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released appearing on espns first take bayless a noted supporter of manziel did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking my concern i repeatedly said was if johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails then im going to be out said bayless in talking to people in and around the cleveland browns i believe johnny manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol and i believe that it is time for johnny to get some help he continues to lie to his executives to his coaches to his teammates to the media and most of all he continues to lie to himself he then said he would label manziel an alcoholic manziel was known for his partying while at texas am but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl draft noting that he had grown up before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland just days into his training with the browns however the local press began calling him out on his partying which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field a source told clevelandcom at the time team officials had bought into manziels predraft promises to tone down the partying and leave his fratboy lifestyle back in college station texas and theyve been stunned by his nonstop antics a photo snapped of manziel before the start of the season and later posted to instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas am university aggies also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of manziel and later posted to instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine browns head coach mike pettine spoke to manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the nfl and said he felt that things were back on track and that manziel was focused on football once again there was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident it was the fan who was inebriated not manziel it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by espn in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks manziel would later claim this report was false and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the cleveland browns on april 20 as for his future with the browns that is a little unclear some including espns pat mcmanamon have called on the browns to fire manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year saying he and fellow player josh gordon have a complete lack of professionalism gordon was also out with manziel and showed up late for the team walkthrough an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season currently manziel has a four year contract with the browns worth about 825 million the 22yearold also has some of the most coveted and lucrative endorsement deals in the sports world with among others nike mcdonalds musclepharm and snickers for now though manziel seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football when manziel is back it will be full speed ahead for him said pettine i think hes very anxious at this point well be prepared as we will with every other player when they get back to town were going to coach the heck out of them\n",
            "Summary: johnny manziel has been released from rehab after checking into a facility on january 28 . the cleveland browns quarterback is out and ready to begin offseason workouts with the team which begin on april 20 . many are still wondering what future manziel will have in the nfl as he will compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position .\n",
